# Susceptibility Zoning plugin (SZ)

**! This README file is a draft and is currently being improved**

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a plugin for [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org), called "Susceptibility Zoning plugin", aiming at creating maps of susceptibility to various natural forcing elements.

The plugin has been developed with a main focus and application towards landslides susceptibility, but it can be applied to different types of natural events.

The plugin uses a two variables "Weight of Evidence" (WoE) model as the first statistical method to the calculation of susceptibility for a study area. Additional methods (_other examples to be added_) are being implemented and will be added to the plugin as soon they are ready.

## How it works


### Weight of Evidence

_Add a short description of WoE and a few useful reference links_

### Input data

### Classification of zones

## Applications

_A few examples and references about Belt and Road Initiative_

## Presentations
